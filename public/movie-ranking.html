<h1>The Best Movies I watched</h1>
 <h2>Based on my humble opinion.</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Shutter Island</h3>
 <p>Great actors, horrifying scenery and a great story. Worth watching multiple times.</p>

 <h3>Inglorious Bastards</h3>
 <p>Again great actors and a really funny take on WW2</p>

 <h3>...?</h3>
 <p>I have to think of one more.</p>
